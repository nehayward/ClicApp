A simple menubar app to trigger HomeKit scenes. Huge shoutout to [@steventroughtonsmith](https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith) and his sample project [airqualitymonitor](https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/airqualitymonitor) for the inspiration and showing how to create a menubar application for controlling Homekit.
